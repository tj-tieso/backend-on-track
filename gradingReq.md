# Getting Started

- _MySQL2_ package (Links to an external site.) to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries,
- _Inquirer_ package (Links to an external site.) to interact with the user via the command line, and the console.table package (Links to an external site.) to print MySQL rows to the console.

Important: You will be committing a file that contains your database credentials. start researching npm packages now that could help you.

You might also want to make your queries asynchronous. MySQL2 exposes a `.promise()` function on Connections to upgrade an existing non-Promise connection to use Promises. To learn more and make your queries asynchronous, refer to the npm documentation on MySQL2 (Links to an external site.).

Design the database schema as shown in the following image:
